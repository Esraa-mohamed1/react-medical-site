    title: 'What is Stress?',
    intro: 'Stress is a natural response to a perceived threat or challenge. When our brain senses danger, it triggers the release of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol.',

      'These hormones prepare the body to respond to the perceived threat, whether it is by fighting, fleeing, or freezing. In small doses, stress can be helpful as it can motivate us to take action and solve problems. However, chronic stress can have negative effects on our physical and mental health.',
      'It can be caused by a variety of factors, such as work, relationships, health issues, financial problems, and more. While some stress is normal and can even be beneficial in small doses, chronic stress can have negative effects on our physical and mental health.',
